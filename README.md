This MIPS program evaluates mathematical expressions in postfix Reverse Polish Notation entered by the user through memory-mapped IO and displays the evaluation as an ASCII character of the evaluated number. The memory-mapped input and output is made using CPU interrupts. The resulting number of the expression must be within the limits of printable ASCII characters (from 32 to 176). Each mathematical expression is terminated by a semicolon, indicating the to program that the expression is ready to be evaluated and the result printed.
